This is an optional assignment, but one that is highly recommended.

**Deploying** your app means setting up a server or service that hosts your app publicly on the Internet. Deploying your app is a great way to learn about the deployment process, which is part of every development team's workflow. It also gives you a way to point potential employers, mentors, and others to a working version of your application.

## How To Deploy Your App

This varies quite a bit based on the language and framework your app uses, along with particular host or service you are using. We provide resources on deploying Spring Boot applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and on deploying .NET MVC applications to Azure App Service.

###Going deeper...

[Here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet) another tutorial on deploying an ASP.NET web app with Azure. It's worth noting that if you complete the folling tutorial, you'll also implement a SQL Database!

If your project is not a Java or C# project, consult an instructor or your mentor for guidance on hosting and deployment.
